# ASL-Tutor

This repository is to be used as a learning aide for American Sign Language. This web application uses Angular for the front-end and Flask for the back-end

## Build images and run containers with Docker

Run `docker compose watch` which will start a web application that consists of an Angular front-end (default port `4200`) and a Flask back-end

## Access the application

In your browser navigate to `http://localhost:4200` (or whatever port you defined for the front-end in `docker-compose.yml`).
